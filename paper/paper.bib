	abstract = {X-ray fluorescence ({XRF}) core scanning provides rapid high-resolution (down to 1 mm) records of chemical composition on split sediment cores. The measurements are non-destructive and require very limited sample preparation. The new Avaatech {XRF} Core Scanner, operational since 2002, covers the atomic mass range from Al to U. Instrument parameters, especially tube voltage, can be adjusted to provide optimum settings for selected elements or sets thereof. Owing to the nature of the surface of split sediment cores, particularly effects resulting from sample inhomogeneity and surface roughness, results are semiquantitative, yet provide reliable records of the relative variability in elemental composition downcore. Selected case studies from diverse sedimentary settings in the {NE} Atlantic Ocean illustrate a range of applications of {XRF} logging data. These include preliminary stratigraphic interpretations (glacial-interglacial cycles), provenance studies of the terrigenous sediment fraction, lithological characterization, early diagenetic processes and distinction between carbonate phases (aragonite v. calcite).},

@article{longman:2019,
	abstract = {{XRF} core scanning ({XRF}-{CS}) is a valuable tool, which allows for the rapid, non-destructive geochemical analysis of sediment cores at extremely high (sub-millimetre) resolution. Peat sediments, due to their near-worldwide distribution, high organic content allowing for reliable radiocarbon chronology development, and typically autochthonous nature, have long been used for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions. However, {XRF}-{CS} methods have been utilised on peat sediments relatively rarely. This is due in part to analytical uncertainty relating to high water content, uneven sediment surfaces and high organic matter contents negatively impacting the ability of the approach to reliably reproduce elemental compositions. Here we provide evidence from Mohos peat bog record in central Romania, and, by comparing to {ICP} measurements, indicate the ability of {XRF}-{CS} to consistently investigate the elemental geochemistry of peat sediments for major elements such as Fe and Ti. However, trace element (Cu, Ni and Sc) measurements appear to be unreliable, due in part to measurements approaching detection limits, and the diluting nature of the peat. Further, we investigate the usefulness of the Incoherent/Coherent (inc/coh) scattering ratio as a proxy for organic matter content, concluding that within high-organic sediment such as peat, the ratio does not pick up small shifts ({\textless}5\%) in organic content. Finally, we present a review of approaches applied to investigating peat sediments via {XRF}-{CS} to date, with a number of suggestions for future avenues of research.},

@article{ellis:2019,
	abstract = {The use of X-Ray Fluorescence ({XRF}) Core Scanning for continuous high-resolution analysis of Sr/Ca in corals is investigated here as a new method for analyzing coral material. Corals are valuable archives for generating high resolution palaeoclimate records of sea surface temperatures of the tropical oceans, but traditional methods of analyzing coral geochemistry involve extensive subsampling and wet chemistry techniques to obtain high precision elemental records. More recent developments of micro-beam techniques have limitations in the length of core that can be scanned at any one time. {XRF} core scanning provides a fast, non-destructive method of analyzing long sections of coral cores whilst maintaining a high sampling resolution. Here we apply this method to two modern corals, from the Sunda Strait, Indonesia and One Tree Island, Great Barrier Reef Australia. We find that results show that {XRF} core scanning of corals produce Sr/Ca records that capture the annual cycle, particularly from reef sites with a large sea surface temperature range. Coupled density measurements of the coral skeleton also aid in increasing the utility of {XRF} measurements obtained from coral material, although difficulties remain in reliably reconstructing interannual temperature variability using {XRF} Sr/Ca determinations. We recommend that {XRF} can provide a valuable method of quick and non-destructive screening of coral material, prior to more targeted analysis using traditional destructive geochemical analysis.},

	abstract = {{XRF} core scanning has evolved to become a standard analytical technique for the rapid assessment of elemental, density and textural variations in a wide range of sediments and other materials, with applications ranging from palaeoceanography, paleoclimatology, geology, and environmental forensics to environmental protection. In general, scanning provides rapid, non-destructive acquisition of elemental and textural variations at sub-millimetre resolution for a wide range of materials. Numerous procedural adaptations have been developed for the growing number of applications, such as analyses of unconsolidated, water-rich sediments, powdered soil samples, or resin bags. Here, practical expertise and guidance from the Itrax community, gained over 15 years, is presented that should provide insights for new and experienced users.},

@article{jones:2019,
	abstract = {This study used signal-to-noise ratios to assess the effects of increasing Itrax {XRF} instrument parameters, namely tube voltage, tube current and exposure time, on {XRF} spectra and measurement repeatability. Tests were performed on cores from British and Irish floodplains. Seven combinations of tube voltage and current and six exposure times were compared using signal-to-noise ratios for eight target elements. Signal-to-noise ratios may be substantially improved by selecting instrument parameters, particularly tube voltage, for specific target elements. They can also be used to assess element profile suitability for interpretation by comparison with the limit of quantification. Repeatability was assessed using the standard deviation of measurements in nine repeat scans. The variation in element levels in the majority of profiles is considerably greater than the variability in individual measurements.},

@article{hennekam:2019,
	abstract = {The trace-metal composition of sediments provides important information on (past) environmental conditions, such as bottom water oxygenation, marine productivity, sediment provenance, and pollution. Whereas major and minor elements are often routinely analyzed using X-Ray Fluorescence ({XRF}) core scanning, analysis of trace metals with the same method is not yet established as a routine procedure. Here, we used a recently developed state-of-the-art {XRF} detector with a core scanner (Avaatech) to examine the optimal settings for analyzing a suite of trace metals (V, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo, and U). Settings were optimized for fast analyses of sediment cores by extensive testing of primary energy settings, filters, and exposure times on two eastern Mediterranean Sea sapropel layers that archive episodes of past sea-floor anoxia. We reveal the following most advantageous (i.e., optimized for analytical accuracy and time efficiency) settings: (1) V, Cr, Ni at 20 {kV} with aluminum primary beam filter, (2) Cu, Zn, and U at 30 {kV} with `thick' (125 Î¼m) palladium primary beam filter, and (3) Mo at 50 {kV} with copper primary beam filter. For these trace elements, generally, â¥30 s of measurement are required for obtaining reliable data. Synthetic mixtures show that matrix effects, which are inherent to {XRF} analyses, are of particular importance for V. A correction for these matrix effects on V (e.g., using Compton scattering) may be necessary for samples with a large variability in carbonate content. {XRF} core-scanning measurements on synthetically, laminated sediments show that trace metals with contrasting atomic weights and related {XRF} penetration depths (V and Mo) can be determined at sub-mm resolution. We show that intensity results from the new {XRF} detector can be converted into concentrations using multivariate log-ratio calibration, allowing a fast quantitative prediction of sedimentary trace metal content using {XRF} core scanning.},

	abstract = {The introduction and application of high resolution {XRF} core scanners has made an enormous contribution to palaeoclimate science over the last two decades. These core scanners have become essential analytical tools for the investigation of sedimentary and other natural cumulative records of environmental change. Their widespread adoption by the environmental and geoscience communities has had a significant impact on the ability to systematically record high resolution chemical profiles in marine and lake sediments and soils. The range of applications has broadened beyond sedimentology and palaeoclimatology and now extends into scanning samples of speleothems, corals, mumiyo mounds, rocks, sedimentary nodules, archaeological artefacts, tree sections and melt segregations. Other areas exploiting the capability of {XRF} core scanners are mineral exploration, geotechnical characterisation, soil remediation studies and carbon capture and storage research. As a consequence of their ability to efficiently determine detailed, non-destructive elemental records in sediments and soils, scientific papers published since the year 2000 now number more than 1000.},
